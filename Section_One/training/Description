The training grounds consists of a few different areas; you catch sight of a jousting arena, a running track, and a strength training weight pull. Each of these training areas are in their own directory. Your task is to go into each training area using the cd command. You will need to use ls to figure out what each training area is called. Once in the training area, use ls to accomplish the task in the area. You can type 'done' when you are finished or want to return to the menu.
