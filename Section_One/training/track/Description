The track curves around the outside of the joust arena and the strength training area. The dirt is hard packed and smooth, and you pick up speed pretty easily. As you near the first lap, hurdles appear that you didn't see before. You clear the first one just in time, and manage a much more graceful jump over the second and third one. You make a few more laps before you cool down and catch your breath. You feel good from the cardio.
