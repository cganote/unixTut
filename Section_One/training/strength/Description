The strength training seems pretty prehistoric. There is a harness on the ground that is tied with rope to a huge rock. It looks like generations of soldiers have moved this rock back and forth across this stretch of ground, given the huge rut that is gouged out of the dirt. You shimmy the harness on and put your shoulders into it. Sweat beads down your face by the time you manage to pull the stone across to the other side. You feel unstoppable!
